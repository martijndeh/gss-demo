GSS demo with angular & angular-route illustrating some issues I'm seeing.

```
$ bower install && npm install && node web.js
```

### Case 1

In this example the controller gets delayed by 1 sec and an exception is thrown when GSS boots.

```
$ open http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

### Case 2

In this example the controller gets delayed by 1 sec and an exception is thrown when GSS boots.

```
$ open http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

> Please note: you need to do a full refresh when switching between the test cases.
